## Vendored Dependencies

These are packages that have no official releases at this time and may also have implementation features that will be deprecated once official releases are made.

The plan for these are to replace them as upstream development matures, official releases are made and we are able to migrate to them.

The repositories and commit hashes for each of these are as follows:

| Repository                                      | Commit                                                                        |
